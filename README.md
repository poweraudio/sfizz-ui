## Donating to sfizz

Sfizz and the work in the SFZ tools organization is purely driven by hobbyists
who choose to use their free time to benefit this project.
We firmly believe in the honesty and goodwill of users as a whole,
and we want to promote a healthy relationship to software and to the cost of producing quality software.

No financial returns is explicitely required from using sfizz in any shape.
However, if you feel that sfizz produces value for you or your products,
and if you find that your financial situation allows for it, we put together ways to donate to the project.
You are never compelled to do so, the [CONTRIBUTING] file contains different ways to contribute.

In all of sfizz's governance model, we strive to live in the open.
Finances are no different, and we put in place a process so that the use of donations
is as transparent as possible through our [Open Collective].
We invite you to check out the [GOVERNANCE] file to see how the organization is governed and how are donations handled.
